# kernel-challenge

The goal of the data challenge is to learn how to implement machine learning algorithms, gain understanding about them and adapt them to structural data.
For this reason, we have chosen a sequence classification task: predicting whether a DNA sequence region is binding site to a specific transcription factor.

This project is related to the MVA course Kernel Methods for Machine Learning, 2020-2021, taught by Pr. J. Mairal and JP Vert.


start.py computes the mismatch kernels for k=5 to k=10 for all of the datasets, with m=1. The estimated execution time is about 15 minutes.
